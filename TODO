# TODO

- Support for getting device's status once it becomes online
- Notify multiple device status changes in one message when they happen at the same time

- Check why sending 2 messages in a row in the cli makes the hybridserver confuse

- Manage better handle_read() - instead of doing a while True: which will eventually timeout on a socket.read(), make it call the handle_read function over and over again to sinalise new data

- Think about adding support for a class which does the socket messaging with buffering

Check instability:
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/1 # Fix attempt to send item that is not in `waiting` state
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/2 # Fix or handle `Operation timed out` on connect
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/3 # Fix or handle "timeout: timed out" on send()
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/4 # Check `[Errno 64] EHOSTDOWN` issue on connect()
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/5 # Check `Connection reset by peer` and handle it
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/6 # Fix infinite loop of "Should be read", Disconnect
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/7 # Fix KeyError on HTTP client disconnect

- Evaluate whether we should destroy the hardware module or not when hardware metadata changes
