 # TODO

Needs:
- Support for tuya command timeout (to avoid commands from being sent too late in case of failure)
- Add support for command/response IDs as it's not really possible to guarantee sequential order on a stream of events
  - On hybridserver proto
  - On tuya commands?
- Check why sending 2 messages in a row in the cli makes the hybridserver confuse
- Make {set} get a reply even in case the device doesn't change status

- Support for not queuing similar status update commands
	- Or support for fulfilling all get_status() at once

Majors:
- Define command retry policy - try with another connection? How many attempts?

Improvements:
- Notify multiple device status changes in one message when they happen at the same time
- Encryption support
- User identification
- Proto authorization (http=gets only, native=everything, etc...)
- User authorization

Minors:
- Evaluate whether we should destroy the hardware module or not when hardware metadata changes

Later:
- Implement "/api/device/discovery" with {new} and {lost}

Issues:
Check instability - might be related to OSX issue with ARP:
