 # TODO

Needs:
- Support for expirable queues (items with expire time) - this will help the syncproto and future session support
- Implement session support for hooks API
- Implement hsclockd with session support
  - Timeout support (turn off device after X minutes)
  - Scheduling sets
- Think how to update configurations via API
- Encryption support
	- Configurable need for encryption
- Cleanup {'origin': 'UNKNOWN'} - This should be in a single place
- Understand how a new status can be found by `request` (cache expires?)


Majors:
- Define command retry policy - try with another connection? How many attempts?
  - Implement Tuya retry policy
- Work out a better logging format

Improvements:
- Implement session support for users (queuing updates for a little while)
- Think on how to update hooks and scheduling configuration via API
- Detect and log infinite loops on read and/or write and make them stop
- Get and log client_id (web, device, etc...)
- Notify multiple device status changes in one message when they happen at the same time
- Authorization
	- User permission settings and validation
- Move "get_status_on_start" to device.py instead of being in tuya.py
- Check error on device start (seems to not count as connect error)
    - Not too important. Maybe addressed when we move get_status_on_start to device.py
- hw/tuya.pt TODO#1 - When we change device IP, decide what to do with the commands already sent to the previous IP - perhaps just resend them all?
- Authorization:
	- Proto authorization (http=gets only, native=everything, etc...)
- Add multithreading support to hooks server

Minors:
- Evaluate whether we should destroy the hardware module or not when hardware metadata changes


Later:
- Implement "/api/device/discovery" with {new} and {lost}


Issues:
Check instability - might be related to OSX issue with ARP:
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/1 # Fix attempt to send item that is not in `waiting` state - ongoing, added logging and changed a few things to change the status of `sent` to `waiting` in case of disconnect
- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/13 # Don't read infinitely
