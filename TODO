 # TODO

Needs:
- Support for OpenTSDB
- Timeout support (turn off device after X minutes)
- Encryption support
	- Configurable need for encryption
- Add support for "pushing metrics" kind-of-devices (water tank)
- Cleanup {'origin': 'UNKNOWN'} - This should be in a single place

Majors:
- Define command retry policy - try with another connection? How many attempts?
  - Implement Tuya retry policy
- Work out a better logging format

Improvements:
- Add support for storing events in a queue when they arrive and processing them in case hshookd dies
- Get and log client_id (web, device, etc...)
- Detect and log infinite loops on read and/or write and make them stop
- Notify multiple device status changes in one message when they happen at the same time
- Authorization
	- Proto authorization (http=gets only, native=everything, etc...)
	- User permission settings and validation
- Move "get_status_on_start" to device.py instead of being in tuya.py
- Check error on device start (seems to not count as connect error)
    - Not too important. Maybe addressed when we move get_status_on_start to device.py
- hw/tuya.pt TODO#1 - When we change device IP, device what to do to commands already sent to the previous IP - perhaps just resend them all

Minors:
- Evaluate whether we should destroy the hardware module or not when hardware metadata changes


Later:
- Implement "/api/device/discovery" with {new} and {lost}


Issues:
Check instability - might be related to OSX issue with ARP:

- https://github.com/davidfoliveira/homeswitch-api/issues/13 # Don't read infinitely
