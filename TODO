# TODO

- Check why sending 2 messages in a row in the cli makes the hybridserver confuse
- Check why client gets disconnected when the targetted device is offline
- In memory switch status support to avoid running a live get (run it periodically)
- async.parallel()
- Evaluate whether we should destroy the hardware module or not
- Manage better handle_read() - instead of doing a while True: which will eventually timeout on a socket.read(), make it call the handle_read function over and over again to sinalise new data
