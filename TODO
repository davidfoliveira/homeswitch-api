# TODO

Needs:
- Add support for command/response IDs as it's not really possible to guarantee sequential order on a stream of events
- Check why sending 2 messages in a row in the cli makes the hybridserver confuse
- Manage better handle_read() - instead of doing a while True: which will eventually timeout on a socket.read(), make it call the handle_read function over and over again to sinalise new data

Majors:
- Notify multiple device status changes in one message when they happen at the same time

Improvements:
- Think about adding support for a class which does the socket messaging with buffering

Minors:
- Evaluate whether we should destroy the hardware module or not when hardware metadata changes


Issues:
Check instability - might be related to OSX issue with ARP:
