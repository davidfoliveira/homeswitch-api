 # TODO

Needs:
- Support for hooks (Slack, OpenTSDB, ...)
- Consider devices unhealthy/gone
- Encryption support
	- Configurable need for encryption

Majors:
- Define command retry policy - try with another connection? How many attempts?
  - Implement Tuya retry policy
- Work out a better logging format

Improvements:
- Get and log client_id (web, device, etc...)
- Detect and log infinite loops on read and/or write and make them stop
- Notify multiple device status changes in one message when they happen at the same time
- Authorization
	- Proto authorization (http=gets only, native=everything, etc...)
	- User permission settings and validation
- Move "get_status_on_start" to device.py instead of being in tuya.py


Minors:
- Evaluate whether we should destroy the hardware module or not when hardware metadata changes


Later:
- Implement "/api/device/discovery" with {new} and {lost}


Issues:
Check instability - might be related to OSX issue with ARP:
